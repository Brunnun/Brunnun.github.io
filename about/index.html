    <p>Welcome to my website! I am Bruno do Rosario Petrucci, a biologist/applied mathematician/failed physicist interested in large scale mathematical patterns in the process of species diversification, and the methods of simulation and inference we can develop from those patterns. I am also passionate about conservation biology, and the attempt to ally my passion for biodiversity with my mathematics and evolutionary biology skillset is a constant in my career. The current idea is to develop flexible simulations of mass extinction events, and from there create and tune accurate inference methods that might give us predictive power to inform conservation decisions for the 21st century biodiversity crisis. I do not know if this will work, but the desire to unite conservation and paleobiology is what drives my research forward.</p>

    <p>I am currently a PhD student under <a href="https://phyloworks.org">Professor Tracy A. Heath</a> of the <a href="https://www.eeob.iastate.edu">Department of Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology</a> at Iowa State University, studying Bayesian phylogenetics and hopefully developing a project on mass extinction events and their part in combating the sixth mass extinction. I have also worked with many talented and inspiring people in the past. During my undergraduate degree I worked with <a href="https://geosci.uchicago.edu/people/michael-foote/">Professor Michael Foote</a> at the University of Chicago, who inspired me to continue my path in paleobiology. In one particularly productive Summer I worked under <a href="https://labmeme.github.io">Professor Tiago Quental</a> from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, whose insight and problem solving skills pushed me to improve beyond my limits. Finally, I have to thank <a href="http://dwyerlab.uchicago.edu/">Professor Greg Dwyer</a>, who in/troduced me to the world of theoretical biology. I will never be able to repay the service these talented researchers have done to my career.</p>

    <p>When I am not coding or being confused about biology, you can find me playing Magic: The Gathering or Hearthstone, or reading some fantasy book, usually written by George R. R. Martin. While the pandemic has disrupted my other hobbies, I also usually have one or two bands to play drums with, and try to do animal right activism at any point I have free time and energy.</p>
