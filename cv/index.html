<p>I finally managed to figure out how to link my CV from Overleaf directly to my website, which is exciting! But I cannot figure out how to put it here. For the meantime, check it out <a href="https://brpetrucci.github.io/brpetrucci-CV/CV.html">here</a>. I am aware it looks ugly, going to work on that later!</p>
