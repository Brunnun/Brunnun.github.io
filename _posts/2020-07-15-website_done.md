I can finally say the website is ready! Pretty empty still, but things are working out. It now has the [custom domain](https://brpetrucci.com) I wanted, I was able to put my CV under my picture with the rest of my contacts, and the About section is done. 

I'll add here the list of things I still want to do to keep myself accountable!

- Edit the way the site behaves with window resizing.
- Edit how it looks on mobile - probably very related to above.
- Add a "fun" section, probably to talk about Magic, Game of Thrones and other geeky things I'm interested in. Not sure if I will, but seems interesting.

For now this is it! Now I should go cook lunch and read some papers about mass extinctions. Thank you for reading!
